    "\n",
    ">C1. Although they present interesting results, I believe that the manuscript is\n",
    "not appropriate for publication in Physical Review Letters. The primary reason\n",
    "is that it does not contains enough 'new' physics, since most of the issues have\n",
    "been already discussed in literature. For example, TRSB superconductivity in\n",
    "connection with iron pnictides has been extensively discussed in the literature.\n",
    "Also, GL approaches have been often used (actually, the GL functional is the\n",
    "same as in Ref. [7]), and the existence of multiple length scales has been\n",
    "discussed. It has been also discussed the fact that TRSB superconductors cannot\n",
    "be categorized neither into type-I nor type-II.\n",
    "\n",
    "R1. We cannot agree with Referee A at all. Let us check the comments one by one,\n",
    "noting that this Referee has confused many facts, with an outlandish context.\n",
    "\n",
    "R.1.1. First, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 1, we have revealed for the\n",
    "first time a novel Josephson effect of the TRSB superconductivity. Based on an\n",
    "analytic calculation for a junction of constriction, we demonstrate that the\n",
    "critical Josephson current between the two TRSB states is much suppressed from\n",
    "the one between a same state. This prototype constriction junction can be used\n",
    "to detect the brand new TRSB superconductivity. This new and, in our opinion,\n",
    "important result is clearly documented in our manuscript, and captured by\n",
    "Referee B. It is strange why Referee A overlooks this part when s/he made\n",
    "comments. In order to emphasize this result we add it to the title of our paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "R1.2. The TRSB superconductivity was discussed back in 1998 (Ref.5), and then in\n",
    "2010 after the discovery of iron-pnicited superconductors (Ref.6), as introduced\n",
    "in our manuscript with respect to their importance. However, we notice that the\n",
    "previous papers treated primarily the isotropic case, a situation very rare, if\n",
    "not impossible, in reality, and did not discuss whether the TRSB\n",
    "superconductivity exists in a more general situation. This issue of stability is\n",
    "highly nontrivial and especially important for this novel superconductivity as\n",
    "discussed in our manuscript. For the first time, we formulate explicitly the\n",
    "stability conditions in terms of GL theory. This new result is very important\n",
    "since it is useful for future searches on candidate TRSB superconductors from\n",
    "relevant materials. In order to emphasize this result we add it to the title of\n",
    "our paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "R.1.3. The GL theory is very general since it is based on the symmetry\n",
    "consideration. In this sense, our GL free-energy functional should not be\n",
    "different from previous works FORMALLY. It is therefore not surprising that Eq.1\n",
    "is similar to those in previous works. The unique contribution of the present\n",
    "work is to reveal novel properties and the conditions for them to appear, in\n",
    "terms of explicit relations among the coefficients of the GL functional. Note\n",
    "even the ground-breaking work by Abrikosov on vortex states in type II\n",
    "superconductivity started from the same free-energy functional used by Ginzburg\n",
    "and Landau previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "R.1.4. The existence of multi divergent lengths of superconductivity coherence\n",
    "has not been addressed in literature, oppositely to the comment from Referee A\n",
    "(Ref.7 even did not touch upon this issue). It should be emphasized that, there\n",
    "are no multi divergent lengths of superconductivity coherence in two-component\n",
    "superconductivity, needless to say their absence in single-component one. It is\n",
    "also impossible in a three-component TRS-reserved case. The existence of multi\n",
    "divergent lengths of superconductivity coherence, besides the London penetration\n",
    "depth, is a property unique to the TRSB superconductivity, as revealed for the\n",
    "first time in the present work, oppositely to the comment of this Referee.\n",
    "Referee A confused the multi divergent lengths of superconductivity coherence\n",
    "with multi length scales, the latter was recently discussed for two-component\n",
    "case. Here we wish to make it clear that, since GL theory is in principle\n",
    "justified close to Tc with small order parameter(s), the important length scales\n",
    "are the divergent ones. In two-component superconductors, there is only one\n",
    "divergent coherence-length for a finite inter-component coupling, which means\n",
    "directly that close to Tc a two-component superconductor behaves as a\n",
    "single-component one. As addressed in the present manuscript, the present TRSB\n",
    "superconductivity realized in systems of three components is really a novel\n",
    "state with unique properties beyond conventional theory developed for\n",
    "single-component superconductivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "R.1.5. We have calculated explicitly the nucleation magnetic field, the\n",
    "thermodynamic critical field, and the coherence length. With these analytic\n",
    "results, we conclude that the TRSB superconductivity cannot be categorized into\n",
    "type I and II according to the GL number kappa. The results are not available in\n",
    "any literature, and the failure of categorization of TRSB superconductivity into\n",
    "type I and II has not yet been discussed in literature so far, oppositely to the\n",
    "comment from this Referee.\n",
    "\n",
    "R.1.6. We notice that the present TRSB superconductivity exhibits two\n",
    "divergent lengths associated with the coherence of superconductivity, besides\n",
    "the London penetration depth, in contrast to two-component superconductors.\n",
    "Therefore, the possibility that vortices attract each other when far away (but\n",
    "repel when close) occurs in all the temperature regime below critical point, in\n",
    "a sharp contrast to two-component cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all these novel results, we believe that the present contribution contains\n",
    "new and important physics, as captured by Referee B and clearly phrased in the\n",
    "report.\n",
    "\n",
    ">C2: I also think that the authors have not taken full advantage of the existing\n",
    "literature. There are quite a lot of papers in the literature that are relevant\n",
    "to the issues they study in the present manuscript. I will mention just one of\n",
    "them (a recent one) by Stanev and Tesanovic, \"Three-band superconductivity and\n",
    "the order parameter that breaks time-reversal symmetry\", PRB 81, 134522 (2010),\n",
    "a work that is also inspired by iron pnictides.\n",
    "\n",
    "R2. We have cited the papers mostly relevant to the present work, and noticed\n",
    "clearly their importance to the field in the very beginning of our manuscript.\n",
    "The work by Stanev and Tesanovic, \"Three-band superconductivity and the order\n",
    "parameter that breaks time-reversal symmetry\", PRB 81, 134522 (2010), was also\n",
    "cited (Ref. 6). We wish to make it clear that the results presented in this\n",
    "manuscript are original, and in our opinion, go beyond the previous works. If\n",
    "this Referee thinks the reference list is not complete, we would be very happy\n",
    "to learn from this Referee on the paper(s) we should include. If this Referee\n",
    "claims that a part of the present work was already addressed by the paper of\n",
    "Stanev and Tesanovic, or other papers, s/he is better to indicate it clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we cannot agree with the comments from this Referee which are biased\n",
    "by misunderstanding. We would be pleased if this Referee considers the results\n",
    "presented in this manuscript more carefully.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Reply to Referee B\n",
    "\n",
    ">C0: In this paper the authors make a very interesting report on time reversal\n",
    "broken superconductivity induced by frustrated inter component coupling in\n",
    "absence of magnets. The paper is topical and interesting however it raises many\n",
    "questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "R0: First of all, we thank Referee B for the very nice words on our\n",
    "contribution. For the questions we try to answer one by one in what follows.\n",
    "\n",
    ">C1. The authors point out in the abstract that their paper stems from recently\n",
    "discovered Fe-pnictide superconductors. However it should be pointed out that in\n",
    "Fe-pnictide superconductors, by definition, ferromagnetism is present. So what\n",
    "is the realistic system they are talking about or is their proposal aimed to see\n",
    "such type of state in an yet to be discovered superconductor?\n",
    "\n",
    "R1. In the recently discovered iron-pnictide superconductors, there are strong\n",
    "antiferromagnetic fluctuations contributed from d-orbits of Fe atoms, and there\n",
    "is no ferromagnetic order in these systems. Actually, it is the very\n",
    "breakthrough brought about to the field of superconductivity by the discovery of\n",
    "iron-pnictide superconductors; before the discovery, it was generally believed\n",
    "that Fe atoms would contribute to a ferromagnetic order which tends to break\n",
    "Cooper pairs, and thus suppresses superconductivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, we would like to notice that there is no established microscopic\n",
    "theory, and no confirmed experimental evidence either, for the coexistence of\n",
    "magnetism and superconductivity in these materials. Therefore, it is natural not\n",
    "to include a magnetic part in the GL free-energy functional. The time-reversal\n",
    "symmetry breaking discussed here is purely caused by the frustrated couplings\n",
    "among superconducting components. It is unique since it is not accompanied by an\n",
    "internal magnetic field like a triplet superconductor.\n",
    "\n",
    ">C2. The GL free energy for multicomponent superconductor as mentioned in eq. 1\n",
    "is based on what? Is it just in analogy to a single component superconductor or\n",
    "is there a way to derive it. There seems to be no references cited as to how\n",
    "this eq. 1 came about. In the references cited the GL free energy for multi\n",
    "component superconductor is mentioned quite differently (Stanev et.al PRB 81,\n",
    "134522).\n",
    "\n",
    "R2. References were cited just below Eq.1 (Ref.s 5, 7, 12 and 13). In Ref. 13,\n",
    "the detailed GL free-energy functional was given explicitly for a two-component\n",
    "superconductor by the quantities of BCS theory. A very similar expression was\n",
    "explicitly given in Ref. 5. The extension to three components is\n",
    "straightforward. In our manuscript, we use the simplest version including only\n",
    "inter-band Josephson-like couplings, since first they are the lowest-order, and\n",
    "thus the most prominent, inter-band interactions, and second the novel features\n",
    "can be captured by the minimal free-energy functional (Eq.1 in our manuscript),\n",
    "and third we have made sure that including more terms will not change the novel\n",
    "physics addressed here. We mentioned this at the end of paragraph of Eq. 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GL free-energy functional can also be composed in analogy to single\n",
    "component superconductor by including possible inter-component couplings, as\n",
    "already noticed by Referee, benefitting from the great concept of GL theory on\n",
    "the order parameters. In this sense, the expression of GL free-energy functional\n",
    "itself is very much general. The unique contribution of the present work is to\n",
    "reveal novel properties and the conditions for them to appear, in terms of\n",
    "relations among the coefficients of the GL functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please be noticed that the paper by Stanev et al. (Ref. 6) did not discuss the\n",
    "GL free-energy functional. They discussed the free energy within a simplified\n",
    "BSC scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    ">C3. The Jospehson current is one of the main results, the formula for Josephson\n",
    "current in a multi component superconducting system hasn't been mentioned\n",
    "anywhere. Only the result is mentioned in Eq. 16. I would like a similar eqn. as\n",
    "mentioned in M. Tinkham ch.4, page 117 eq. 4.14. What is the meaning of\n",
    "chirality in case of a superconductor? Perhaps a figure could better explain the\n",
    "suppression of critical current.\n",
    "The paper should be accompanied via a supplementary material wherein all the\n",
    "details of the various calculations should be mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "R3. First, we thank Referee B very much for the comment on our presentations. In\n",
    "order to emphasize the importance of the Josephson effect in the present TRSB\n",
    "superconductivity, we add it into the title of our manuscript. We have also\n",
    "included more descriptions on the derivations of our results. First, we add a\n",
    "short note for one of the stability conditions below Eq.4. Second, we add a note\n",
    "in Ref. 16 on the absence of degenerated root for attractive (positive in our\n",
    "definition) inter-component couplings, which helps one to understand the\n",
    "emergence of the TRSB solution. Third, we add a short note below Eq.12 for the\n",
    "two divergent lengths of superconductivity coherence, pointing clearly that it\n",
    "is related with the doubly degenerated root at Tc as in Fig.2. Fourthly, we have\n",
    "revised the description on derivation of the wave functions in the constriction\n",
    "junction (please see the paragraph starting with Finally let us investigate the\n",
    "Josephson current . Fifthly, we have included the formula on the Josephson\n",
    "current for three-component superconductors (see Eq.16), following the\n",
    "suggestions of Referee B. These revisions make the derivations of our main\n",
    "results accessible reasonably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile we believe that other minor details are almost straightforward, and do\n",
    "not warrant a supplementary material. We would be very much pleased if Referee B\n",
    "could reconsider this suggestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We appreciate Referee B very much for the comment on chirality, which we\n",
    "borrowed from one of the references (Ref. 7). Indeed, chirality in physics\n",
    "usually refers to the situation when a phenomenon is not identical to its mirror\n",
    "image, and thus is irrelevant to the present system of superconductivity. We\n",
    "therefore refrain from using the concept of chirality in our manuscript. Please\n",
    "let us note that the physics addressed here does not change with this revision.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the suppression of Josephson current between two TRSB states, we notice\n",
    "that the total Josephson current is just the summation of Josephson currents for\n",
    "individual components, as in Eq.16. For the TRSB cases illustrated in Fig. 1, it\n",
    "is easy to see that a large cancellation occurs among those for individual\n",
    "components, and for the isotropic case, namely all components share the same\n",
    "strength and the same coupling with other components, the total Josephson\n",
    "current is suppressed to zero. Please let us notice that the physics discussed\n",
    "here remains the same even including full inter-component couplings. We believe\n",
    "that the physics here has been demonstrated quite clearly (Eqs. 16 and 17, and\n",
    "Fig.1), and an additional figure seems duplicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we would like to thank Referee B for his critical reading, valuable\n",
    "comments, and very positive assessment on our contribution. The criticisms\n",
    "certainly help us to sharpen our presentation. We sincerely hope that our\n",
    "revisions can accommodate the comments, and appreciate very much the\n",

On the other hand, we wish to bring a technical point to the attention of Editor, namely most of the questions or comments in the second report could well be raised, and thus addressed, in the first round.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "R3. The isotropic case was mentioned in the paragraph starting with “Next we investigate the coherence length …” (the paragraph before the one including Eq.11). We apologize for that the definition on the isotropic/anisotropic cases was not clear enough in our previous versions. In the present study, an isotropic system is defined with the coefficients in Eq.1 as a_1=a_2=a_3=a, b_1=b_2=b_3=b, and gamma_12 =gamma_13 =gamma_23 =gamma. The phase differences are given by \\phi_21= phi_32= phi_13= 2 pi/3 (with phi_jk=-phi_kj). In an anisotropic system, some of the coefficients are different in different bands in Eq.1.

    "\n",
    "R4. We are sorry for that we only noticed the citations in our previous reply. As Referee B put, Eq.1 is the very starting point of the present work, and is thus very important. We revise our description on Eq.1, following the comment of Referee B. For details please see the revised manuscript around Eq.1.\n",

    "\n",
    "R5. We include a paragraph a the last part of the manuscript for perspective, as suggested by Referee B, noticing two possible intriguing future directions: (1) vortex state of this TRSB superconductivity should be interesting due to the novel phase distribution among components, and (2) tunneling with other TRSB materials, such as triplet superconductor and/or magnetic materials. We delete the discussion on the GL theory at lower temperature. Please see the last paragraph of the manuscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the question from Referee B, let us mention that many phenomena predicted by GL theory, which is only justified for temperature close to Tc, have been observed down to low temperature regime. A good example is the Abrikosov vortex lattice state, which is derived primarily based on GL theory, but turns out to occupy the whole temperature regime. The reason for this is primarily due to the fact that the system is governed by the ratio between coherence length and penetration depth, which is temperature independent. Another reason could be that the corrections to the GL theory only cause small deviations. But this discussion is beyond the scope of the present paper.\n",
    "\n",
    ">C6. Finally the authors should compare the results of their work with other works on Iron-pnictide and/or ferromagnetic superconductors to reveal pairing symmetries. Examples are many, few of note are:\n",

    "R6. As pointed out by Referee B, tunneling phenomena have been investigated extensively so far, for triplet superconductor by Bolech and Giamarchi, those involving interface between single-band metal and iron-based superconductor by Linder and Sudbo, and Araujo and Sacramento, and that of a ferromagnetic insulator by Kawabata et al.  In contrast to the previous works, our setup of Josephson junction is based on a constriction structure, with a short and thin bridge between two bulks of otherwise a single superconducting material. In this system, Cooper pairs transmit through the bridge from three bands to three bands on the two sides. The wave functions are described by the GL equations, and the Josephson current can be evaluated directly, as in Eq.17, following the idea by Larkin for single-component superconductivity nicely documented in the book by Tinkham. As revealed in our manuscript, the result is however very interesting due to the interference among multi components. The present novel Josephson effect is caused by the TRSB property of the composite wave function, not by the pairing symmetry of individual components. We add a new paragraph (the one before the last paragraph of the manuscript) for this discussion. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we really appreciate the comments from Referee B, which help us improve much our presentation. We have revised our manuscript following the comments by Referee B, namely giving a detailed description on GL functional, a comparison between the present Josephson effect and previous works, and a perspective. On the other hand, we notice that the calculation by Referee B reproduces exactly our result on critical Josephson current, noting that the phase difference carries a sign. We sincerely hope that our revisions accommodate all the criticisms of Referee B, and would be very pleased if s/he could recommend the publication of our contribution in PRL.\n",

    "### Referee C -- LC13464/Hu\n",
    "\n",
    "I agree with all the comments of both previous referees, and reach the same conclusion: the paper is not suitable for publication in Phys. Rev. Lett. The present version might be published as a Brief Report, but in my opinion the authors should better expand it into a full-size Phys. Rev. B article, addressing in the process the criticisms raised by the referees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper is an extension of the Phys. Rev. B by Agternerg et al. (Ref. 5 of the manuscript) and includes several interesting results that, once properly explained and based, deserve publication; Ref. 5 considered the isotropic case, the present authors address a more general Landau-Ginzburg (LG) functional. However, whereas the paper by Agterberg et al. is built on a physical system, elaborating on the underlying symmetries that lead to the LG expression they treat, the present paper simply assumes a certain LG expression and then minimizes it. From the perspective of the reader, the authors could have considered a magnetically-ordered system (with several competing interactions) as well. I give as an example the works of D. Mukamel in the 70’s on (magnetic) coupled x-y models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, both referees, in particular B, point out that the LG expression is introduced out of thin air, without relating it to any specific system (even after the second submission!). In that context, I find the reply of the authors to Referee A unacceptable :“However, we notice that the previous papers treated primarily the isotropic case, a situation very rare, if not impossible, in reality, and did not discuss whether the TRSB superconductivity exists in a more general situation.” The present article does not offer any relation to a real physical system, except for announcing right at the beginning that it has to do with “our understanding of the birth of the universe (!)”. Furthermore, referee A commented that the fact that such superconductors cannot be categorized neither into type I nor into type II has been already discussed in the literature. Instead of properly answer him, the authors chose to declare “the failure of categorization of TRSB superconductivity into type I and II has not yet been discussed in literature so far, oppositely to the comment from this Referee.” This is simply not true. Typing “Type 1.5 superconductivity” in Google yielded 428,000 entries. It might be that the reason is different than in the present analysis, but still one expects the authors to comment on the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas the authors address the genuine comments of Referee A rather aggressively (for no ap- parent reason), they treat Referee B extremely politely, but nonetheless, fail to supply the required clarifications. For example, referee B pointed out the possibility of a magnetic order in the pnictides, which is not included in the GL expression (1) of the manuscript. As the only physical system they mention is the iron pnictides, I find the authors’ reply “Meanwhile, we would like to notice that there is no established microscopic theory, and no confirmed experimental evidence either, for the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity in these materials. Therefore, it is natural not to include a magnetic part in the GL free-energy functional. The time-reversal symmetry breaking discussed here is purely caused by the frustrated couplings among superconducting components. It is unique since it is not accompanied by an internal magnetic field like a triplet superconductor.” )\n",
    "very unsatisfactory. What is then the reason for the frustrated couplings? in which physical system can they be realized? (I am echoing the comments of referee B.)\n",
    "\n",
    "I also find their comment (both in the manuscript and in their reply to referee B) “and third we have made sure that including more terms—in the GL expression– will not change the novel physics addressed here.” What do they mean? which additional terms did they check? Equation (1) of the manuscript includes just one possible combination of the fourth-order terms, out of many more (see Ref. 5 in this context), for example, terms that couple the three order parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the paper presents an interesting analysis of the GL expression which includes three superconducting order-parameters with competing interactions. The authors are advised to revise their work along the lines proposed by the previous referees. I think that they should relate their work to actual systems, and also to similar problems appearing in the context of magnetism (i.e., coupled x-y models, and maybe even multi-ferroics).\n",

    ">C1. The fact phi_21 - phi_31 = phi_23 mentioned in the response isn't\n",
    "mentioned anywhere in the manuscript.\n",

    "A1: We took this as trivial. As it may cause confusion, we include this relation into manuscript. \n",
    "\n",
    ">C2. With the isotropic condition mentioned I_c = sqrt(i_1 (i_1 - i_2) + i_2 (i_2 - i_3)+ i_3 (i_3 -i_1)). This will only be zero when i_1 =i_2 =i_3. This condition can be met even in anisotropic case depending on parameters. Further the authors in the response reveal that result reveals interference among components. As mentioned i_1 =i_2 =i_3 implies one and one thing only absence of interference among components. How do they explain the contradiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "A2: For isotropic case, the total critical current I_c is suppressed to zero due to cancellations among the tunneling currents of individual components. We used the term “interference” for this cancellation in our last response (R6). We apologize if the term “interference” brought confution, but please let us make it clear that there is no contradiction here. \n",
    "\n",
    "As noticed by Referee, i_1=i_2=i_3 can be achieved in anisotropic cases since they are determined by phi_j and m_j. But if psi_j are different for the three components, phase differences phi_jk should be different from 2 pi/3, and thus one cannot have the relation I_c = sqrt(i_1 (i_1 - i_2) + i_2 (i_2 - i_3)+ i_3 (i_3 -i_1)) any more. \n",

    "A3: We thank the Referee for the kind proof reading. We correct it in the revised manuscript. \n",
    "\n",
    ">C4. Although a perspective on tunneling is welcome, the authors have completely ignored other methods to detect pairing symmetries in ferromagnetic or pnictide superconductors. Especially comparison with crossed andreev reflection and/or josephson effect with non-superconducting material sandwiched between superconductors is lacking. I wonder why? Since in their system there is no non-superconducting materials the benefits as well as deficiencies of their method as compared with others should be brought forward. All in all the authors changes are cosmetic they lack a real willingness to modify and correct the manuscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "A4: We think the constriction junction structure is the best setup for detecting the TRSB superconducting state, wish to make it clear that this constriction junction is not designed for detecting the pair symmetry of iron-pnictide superconductivity. In what follows we discuss briefly whether Andreev reflection and other junctions are suitable for detecting the TRSB state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Andreev reflection is sensitive to spin state of quasiparticle, and thus symmetry of Cooper pairing. Therefore, it is very useful for investigating the p-wave superconductor such as Sr_2RuO_4. We don’t think a conventional experimental set up for Andreev reflection can detect the phases of superconductivity gap functions, which is the most important quantity in the present TRSB state. The phases of gap functions can best be measured by Josephson junctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "S/I/S junctions may detect the present TRSB states in principle. However, the S/I interfaces cause scatterings between different components, and as a result, the difference in critical Josephson currents for the two possible configurations (same TRSB state vs opposite TRSB states) diminishes, making experimental sensitivity worse, as compared with the constriction junction with short bridge proposed in our work. \n",
    "\n",
    "S/M/S junctions and S/F/S junctions may provide rich physics for the present TRSB state. But the tunneling properties between multi-component superconductor and single-band metal are a matter of recent investigations. Without a well-established understanding on them, a S/M/S hardly provides a clear detection of the present TRSB superconductivity. It is a similar, or even a worse situation for S/F/S junction, since the ferromagnetic layer causes scatterings which break the spin-singlet pairing for individual components for the present TRSB state.  We include these discussions briefly into the concluding part of the manuscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "We apologize for that the last revisions are not good enough. It is because we had no insightful understanding, rather than due to lacking willingness to improve the manuscript. \n",
    "We hope these explanations and revisions to the manuscript can satisfy this Referee, and appreciate very much his/her recommendation.\n",

    "### Third report of Referee C:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">C1: The paper is an extension of the Phys. Rev. B by Agternerg et al. (Ref. 5 of the manuscript) and includes several interesting results that, once properly explained and based, deserve publication; Ref. 5 considered the isotropic case, the present authors address a more general Landau-Ginzburg (LG) functional.

    "\n",
    "A1: We take the work by Agternerg et al. as an important literature, which proposed for the first time the possibility of the TRSB superconductivity caused by frustrated inter-component coupling for systems of multi components, and cite this paper in the introductory part. As correctly noted by this Referee, Agterberg et al discussed the underlying symmetry and arrived at the GL expression. It would be best if one could do the similar analysis for the recent booming iron-pnicitide superconductivity. Unfortunately, it is impossible at this moment since a microscopic theory for this new high-temperature superconductivity is not available, and thus there is no counterpart of the BCS theory used by Agterberg. We thus ask ourselves a different question, namely what are the general conditions at the GL level for a stable TRSB superconductivity with nontrivial phase differences among components. We found that this question can be answered even without knowing the detailed microscopic mechanism, and the TRSB state may be detected by experiments. While we expect the iron-pnictide superconductors, a class of superconductors having more than three components and thus motivating our study, provide a good chance for testing this interesting state, our theory covers more general cases. By the way, the GL expression (1) is not just an assumption. It can be derived from BCS theory for the case that the individual components are of BCS-like s-wave pairing symmetry. The procedures are available in literatures (the review by Gurevich for two-component superconductivity is cited as Ref.13).\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the relation with magnetism, we have different understanding with this Referee. It is well known that the concept of frustration has been widely used for spin systems. For example, in the xy model on triangular lattice with frustrated exchange coupling, spin vectors on the three sublattices take the so-called 120-degree configuration. But this configuration is in the real space, and the phase transition between this state and the high-temperature paramagnetic phase is associated with the breaking of the O(n) symmetry and translational symmetry. If the spin vectors are equivalent at all sites, no magnetization appears in the low-temperature phase, and thus in any sense the time-reversal symmetry is unbroken. In a sharp contrast, in superconductivity, the three components reside simultaneously at every point in the real space. The 120-degree phase differences take place in the k-space, rather than in the real space as in magnetic systems. The phase transition is associated with the breakings of the U(1) symmetry and time-reversal-symmetry, even one considers a system with the isotropic parameters for the three components. Therefore, the phenomena discussed in the present work are completely different from those in magnetic or multi-ferroic systems. \n",

    ">C2: Indeed, both referees, in particular B, point out that the LG expression is introduced out of thin air, without relating it to any specific system (even after the second submission!).

    "\n",
    "We mentioned the importance of the symmetry breaking in various contexts of physics in the introduction. But it is clear that we have not claimed any relation between our GL free-energy and universe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us respond to the comment by this Referee on the categorization of type I and type II superconductivity. The first, and most important, point is the “fact” that there is no discussion in literatures on categorization of type I or type II of the TRSB superconductivity or failure of it. Secondly, our statement is that the GL number kappa=lambda/xi cannot be used to categorize the TRSB superconductivity (type I or type II). This statement is derived from our analytic results on coherence length, nucleation field and thermodynamic critical field. We have not claimed that TRSB superconductivity is a new type one beyond type I and type II. Thirdly, type 1.5 superconductivity mentioned by this Referee is a topic of big controversy. While this issue is beyond the scope of the present work and a full discussion takes another separated paper, we include some inputs here just for the merit of communication with this Referee: \n",
    "\n",
    "The so-called type-1.5 I superconductivity has its root in a paper by Babaev and Speight (Ref. 17) for a two-component system (where TRSB superconductivity impossible) without inter-component coupling. There are papers and discussions on the possibility of type-1.5 in journals and arXiv, both positive and negative to the idea, and thus very controversial. If one calculates carefully a two-component system with finite coupling, it becomes clear that there is only one divergent coherence length, in sharp contrast with TRSB case. When one concentrates on temperature regime close to Tc (in our opinion one should since GL is the starting point), this divergent coherence length dominates over any other non-divergent length scale(s), the system is not different from a single component superconductivity, and especially the system is either type I or type II. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we wish to make it clear that we responded to Referee A with detailed discussions on the issue of categorization of superconductivity (see R.1.4 & R.1.5 in the first report), which we think properly enough, before mentioning briefly the absence of similar discussion in literature related to TRSB state.\n",
    "\n",
    ">C3: Whereas the authors address the genuine comments of Referee A rather aggressively (for no apparent reason), they treat Referee B extremely politely, but nonetheless, fail to supply the required clarifications. For example, referee B pointed out the possibility of a magnetic order in the pnictides, which is not included in the GL expression (1) of the manuscript. As the only physical system they mention is the iron pnictides, I find the authors' reply “Meanwhile, we would like to notice that there is no established microscopic theory, and no confirmed experimental evidence either, for the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity in these materials. Therefore, it is natural not to include a magnetic part in the GL free-energy functional. The time-reversal symmetry breaking discussed here is purely caused by the frustrated couplings among superconducting components. It is unique since it is not accompanied by an internal magnetic field like a triplet superconductor.\" ) very unsatisfactory. What is then the reason for the frustrated couplings? in which physical system can they be realized? (I am echoing the comments of referee B.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A3: We responded to the comments by Referee A directly, but not “aggressively”.  Our responses would be better if softer, but we believe that as a scientific communication, the most important issue is the “fact”. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the absence of competing magnetic order in the GL expression, basically we have already communicated with Referee B in the last rounds. We wish to emphasize here that in most known iron-pnicitide superconductors, superconductivity appears after the “long-range order” of antiferromagnetism is suppressed (no ferromagnetic fluctuation was reported). Since GL theory treats the long-range orders, antiferromagnetism should be dropped as a competing order. As discussed in A1, there is no microscopic derivation of the frustrated inter-component couplings at this moment, and we chose to work on the general condition for the TRSB superconductivity. It is a hope that iron-pnictide superconductors can realize the frustrated situation in certain doping regime.\n",
    "\n",
    ">C4: I also find their comment (both in the manuscript and in their reply to referee B) “and third we have made sure that including more terms -in the GL expression- will not change the novel physics addressed here.\" What do they mean? which additional terms did they check? Equation (1) of the manuscript includes just one possible combination of the fourth-order terms, out of many more (see Ref. 5 in this context), for example, terms that couple the three order parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A4: We thank this Referee for this question. The most important terms which cause the TRSB state is the Josephson-like couplings included in Eq.(1). Couplings we have checked include: (1) cross quadratic terms with gradients of order parameters, (2) all quartic terms including $| \\psi_j|^2| \\psi_k|^2$ and $ \\psi_j \\psi^*_k| \\psi_l|^2$. Including these details will not change the main conclusion of the present work, namely the stability of the TRSB state and the novel Josephson effect, and the process to arrive at these results, but will modify the expressions of some results. In order to respond to this comment we modify our discussions below Eq(1).\n",
    "\n",
    ">C5: In summary, the paper presents an interesting analysis of the GL expression which includes three superconducting order-parameters with competing interactions. The authors are advised to revise their work along the lines proposed by the previous referees. I think that they should relate their work to actual systems, and also to similar problems appearing in the context of magnetism (i.e. coupled x-y models, and maybe even multiferroics).\n",
    "\n",

    ">Coomment-A: the validity of the LG theory: It seems that the authors did not understand my comment. Using the LG functional as a phenomenological theory is quite ubiquitous, and many times very fruitful. However, the claim or the hint that the specific functional they choose to study describes the iron-pnictide superconductors needs some substantiation, either by a careful investigation of symmetries in the pnictides, or by comparing the outcome of the theory with experiments (or both). None of this is presented in this paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reply A: Although the iron-pnictide superconductors with more than three components, and reportedly of frustrated inter-component interactions are the candidate materials for the phenomena addressed in the present work to occur, no microscopic theory for the mechanism for them is available now. A derivation of GL theory is thus impossible at the present stage. We have to admit that we cannot provide a substantiation for our work in this sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "The functional we adopt is not specific for a multi-component superconductor as can be found in literatures for two-component superconductors. For a clean superconductor, one can derive the GL functional following the work by Zhitomirsky and Dao, PRB, 69 (2004) 054508, which was discussed in the review paper by Gurevich, Physica C 456 (2007) 160 (Ref.14 in the present version of manuscript). In order to respond to this comment, we add the paper by Zhitomirsky and Dao to our reference list. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the present work, we derive for the first time the general stability condition for the TRSB superconductivity, and then predict “analytically” several unique properties for this novel state. Up to this moment, there is no direct experimental observation. But we believe that this does not degrade the importance of our theory.   \n",
    "\n",
    ">Comment-B: type I or type II categorization: The authors may have discussed this topic in length in their reply to referee A, but there is no discussion of this point in the paper, and no comparison with other systems (of different symmetries) in which such a categorization is not possible as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reply-B: We calculated analytically thermodynamic field, thermodynamic field, the penetration depth, and two “divergent” coherence lengths for this TRSB superconductivity. One then finds the ratio between the nucleation magnetic field and the thermodynamic field does not equal to \\sqrt{2}\\kappa with \\kappa=\\lambda/\\xi, the Ginzburg-Landau number. Therefore, the conventional classification of superconductor by \\kappa does not work for the present TRSB superconductivity. The statement was clearly put in the manuscript. To be short, the categorization of type I and type II does not fail, but the Ginzburg-Landau number is not the right index for categorization in the present TRSB state.\n",
    "\n",
    "We guess the Referee is requesting us to touch on the so-called type-1.5 superconductors. However, there are several important differences between those works and the present one as follows. First, possible type-1.5 superconductors were discussed for two-component superconductors; Here we reveal the TRSB state in three-component superconductors, which is impossible in two-component superconductors. Secondly, in all two-component superconductors there is only one divergent coherence length; In the present TRSB state, there are two divergent coherence lengths. Thirdly, type-1.5 superconductors (if any) are different from type II superconductors at H_c1; We discuss the behavior of the superconductor around the magnetic field where superconductivity nucleates when lowering the field, namely around H_c for type I, and around H_c2 for type II superconductors. We did have some discussions with Referees A on this point and tried to make the situation clear, namely the present work has no direct relation with those for type-1.5 superconductor. \n",

    "\n",
    "Reply C: This comment is basically same as Comment-A. We repeat our points: the GL functional is not specific. It can be derived from BCS theory for a three-component superconductor. We then formulate the conditions for TRSB state, and reveal its novel  features. We propose a constriction junction setup to test experimentally the addressed TRSB superconductivity. \n",

    "\n",
    "Reply2: We thank the Referee for his assent to our paper.\n",
    "We clarify the novelty and impact of our paper in more detail as\n",
    "follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, our proposal for detecting the existence of Majorana fermions\n",
    "is based on the quantum correlation, or entanglement, between the\n",
    "two QDs close to the two ends of a topological superconductor-wire.\n",
    "To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work which differs\n",
    "from all proposals thus far in literatures based on transport\n",
    "properties, such as the 4$\\pi$ period Josephson current, the Andreev\n",
    "reflection, and the anomalous conductivity. As far as transports are\n",
    "involved, one should always be very careful since the signal of\n",
    "current might be influenced by other factors, such as the interface\n",
    "and/or contact condition. Moreover, the current flowing through the\n",
    "topological superconductor might disturb, or even destroy the\n",
    "Majorana states. In contrast, our proposal is based on weak\n",
    "tunneling, which does not destroy the topological protection of the\n",
    "Majorana fermions. In this sense, our method is a non-invasive one,\n",
    "and forms another category of detection methods of Majorana\n",
    "fermions. Considering the current status of intensive experimental\n",
    "searching for Majorana fermions and that no conclusive confirmation\n",
    "has been reported, our proposal, which is at least complimentary to\n",
    "other proposals raised so far, is expected to be important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, since the QD entanglement is induced by the\n",
    "entanglement of Majorana fermions, our proposal, if successful, not\n",
    "only proves the existence of Majorana fermions, but also their\n",
    "nature of quantum entanglement. Our non-invasive detection on\n",
    "Majorana fermions may also open the door for the quantum\n",
    "non-demolition measurement (QND) of the topological qubit in the\n",
    "future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us discuss the novelty of our work more specifically with\n",
    "respect to Refs 20 and 21. In Ref. 20, Fu studied the transport\n",
    "properties of a topological superconductor in presence of charging\n",
    "energy. He revealed explicitly that Majorana fermions will induce\n",
    "novel transport property when charging effect is taken into account.\n",
    "Therefore, his work belongs to the category involving current\n",
    "signal, which is different from ours as discussed above. Ref. 21 by\n",
    "Flensberg was the first paper which addressed the interaction\n",
    "between Majorana fermions and quantum dots. However, his work is\n",
    "irrelevant to detection of Majorana fermions, which is the key\n",
    "result of our paper. We benefit in formulation from these two nice\n",
    "works, but the physics addressed here is different from theirs.\n",

    ">Comment3: Besides, I have one concern. In order to probe entanglement,\n",
    "one has\n",
    "to be very careful in defining the measuring protocol. I find that the\n",
    "authors should first define more clearly the protocol by which\n",

    "strengthen the discussion on the experimental feasibility. We make a\n",
    "more detailed discussion about the single charge transistor (SET)\n",
    "technique useful for our proposal. It is a small circuit with a\n",
    "mesoscopic metallic island. The conductance of the circuit is\n",
    "sensitive to nearby charges due to Coulomb interaction, thus able to\n",
    "detect the electron occupation of a targeting system. It has been\n",
    "reported experimentally that a well designed radio-frequency SET can\n",
    "detect QD occupation with low charge noise within microseconds. We\n",
    "believe this technology is good enough for the measurement of\n",
    "electron occupation on QDs, which we need for determining the\n",
    "entanglement in our proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the topological superconductor is not measured directly in our\n",
    "proposal, the two QDs are actually in a mixed state. Because\n",
    "entanglement in a mixed state is quite complex, and moreover it is\n",
    "unnecessary to our purpose of detecting Majorana fermions, we simply\n",
    "defined the QD entanglement in our paper as the difference in the\n",
    "occupancy probabilities in one QD when the other QD is occupied or\n",

    "simple and straightforward, namely we detect simultaneously the\n",

    "Majorana fermions, which can be achieved without addressing the Bell\n",
    "inequality which characterizes fully quantum entanglement. In our\n",

    ">Comment1: I have read carefully the article of Z. Wang et al. and I have\n",
    "concluded that it is not ready for publication. Quite frankly I fear the authors\n",
    "have ignored an important part of their system, which I suspect may completely\n",
    "alter their results. Consequently, I am very skeptical what the authors predict\n",
    "will actually be seen in experiment. The paper needs a lot more work before it\n",
    "will be ready for publication, and I suspect the results will be significantly\n",
    "different.\n",
    "My first and most serious comment is that the authors have completely neglected\n",
    "what happens at the edges of the semiconductor nanowire. The Kitaev model does\n",
    "not smoothly deform into an ordinary s-wave superconductor, and in fact the two\n",
    "should be separated by a domain wall with gapless localized quasiparticle\n",
    "states. This must be the case since the Kitaev wire is a topological state,\n",
    "while the s-wave superconductor is not. Given these additional low energy\n",
    "states, the authors need to repeat their analysis taking these other low energy\n",
    "states into account. The results may be completely different as a consequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reply1: First, we thank the Referee for the careful reading. We understand that\n",
    "there are domain walls at the edges of the nanowire, and end Majorana fermions\n",
    "exist there. They correlate with the Majorana fermions at the junction area and\n",
    "in principle may influence the current-phase relation of the Majorana Josephson\n",
    "junction. For the Majorana Josephson junction, we adopted a minimal model, in\n",
    "which these influences were included through a phenomenological perturbation\n",
    "term. We wish to say that this minimal model is sufficient to grasp the physics\n",
    "of the Majorana Josephson junction. We should also admit that this is not a\n",
    "trivial case, as pointed out by this Referee. In order to make this point clear,\n",
    "we include the two end Majorana fermions explicitly. The lowest order\n",
    "perturbation theory then is described by a 4x4 matrix. It is shown explicitly\n",
    "that the 4x4 matrix is block diagonal when the basis is chosen for the\n",
    "electronic occupation, with the upper and lower 2x2 matrices referring to the\n",
    "even and odd parity, respectively. Since the total Hamiltonian commutes with the\n",
    "parity operator, one can focus on each of the parities separately. Therefore,\n",
    "the system of four Majorana fermions is reduced to the 2x2 matrix, which is\n",
    "equivalent to our previous simplified formalism. As for the SQUID, we consider\n",
    "that the maximum supercurrent at domain walls between the conventional\n",
    "superconductor and the topological superconductor is much larger than the\n",
    "critical current of the Majorana Josephson junction. For the detail, please\n",
    "refer to the revised manuscript.\n",

    "Reply4: Yes, we can. Generally, the phase $\\phi$ of the off-diagonal term in the\n",
    "2x2 matrix can be arbitrary, which can be absorbed through a gauge\n",
    "transformation $P_1\\rightarrow P_1, P_2\\rightarrow e^{i\\phi} P_2$, which does\n",

    "Comment B1: In the submitted paper the authors have tried to detect the presence\n",
    "of Majorana bound states via the asymmetric current phase relation. The basic\n",
    "premise of the paper is wrong. An asymmetric current phase relation can be\n",
    "observed in many Josephson junctions for example with d-wave superconductors. In\n",
    "s-wave for the case when magnitude of superconducting gap on either side of\n",

    "et. al in 2004 has this in much more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reply B1: We thank this Referee for raising questions on our work. However, we\n",
    "cannot agree with the comment that the basic premise of the paper is\n",
    "wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, please let us make it clear that there is no asymmetric current phase\n",
    "relation in a single junction involving Majorana fermions. It only exhibits an\n",
    "unconventional CPR with 4-pi period. The key point of our present work is that\n",
    "when a MF junction is combined with a conventional SIS Josephson junction into\n",
    "to SQUID, an asymmetric critical current with respect to the current direction\n",
    "appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose to use this property to probe the Majorana fermions, since successful\n",
    "synthesis of Josephson junction between two topological superconductors has been\n",
    "reported recently (see the paper by Kouwenhoven group, Science vol. 336 (2012)\n",
    "1003), and only one further step is to be taken, namely combining it with a\n",
    "conventional Josephson junction into a SQUID, to provide another signature for\n",
    "Majorana fermions beside the zero-bias conductance, the only evidence for\n",
    "existence of Majorana fermions so far. Therefore, our proposal is experimentally\n",
    "relevant, and timely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although an unconventional current-phase relation (of 4-pi period) can happen in\n",
    "some other cases, such as d-wave superconductivity, and ballistic limit of\n",
    "point-contact junction which have been discussed in RMP by Golubov et. al in\n",
    "2004, they can be distinguished clearly from the present case caused by Majorana\n",
    "fermions, following the way used by Kouwenhoven group (Science vol. 336 (2012)\n",
    "1003). Namely, by tuning either the magnetic field or the chemical potential on\n",
    "the nanowire, one can switch the system between a topological state carrying\n",
    "Majorana fermions, which shows current-phase relation of 4pi period, and a\n",
    "trivial state without Majorana fermions, which shows conventional current-phase\n",
    "relation as reported by J. A. V. Dam et al (Nature vol. 442 (2006) 667).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, our proposal can provide unique, phase-sensitive evidence for\n",
    "Majorana fermions. In order to make this point clear, we include a discussion in\n",
    "our manuscript. For details please see the summary of changes and the\n",
    "manuscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also wish to point out that in an SIS Josephson junction, the CPR should be\n",
    "conventional, i.e. of 2 pi period, and the critical current should be symmetric\n",
    "with respect to the current direction, even when the s-wave superconducting gaps\n",
    "on the two sides of insulator are unequal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment B2: Further, this case of delta_1 \\neq \\delta_2 has been raised by the\n",
    "first referee and unfortunately the authors haven't answered properly. The\n",
    "Josephson current will change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reply B2: As can be seen in Eq. (7), the summation and the difference of the two\n",
    "interactions delta_L and delta_R appear at the off-diagonal terms of the matrix.\n",
    "When one of them becomes zero accidentally, the off-diagonal terms in one of the\n",
    "two blocks disappear, which then falls into the fast-dynamics limit addressed in\n",
    "our manuscript. Otherwise, one may have the adiabatic limit depending on the\n",
    "values of the off-diagonal terms. In any case, the main point of our work,\n",
    "namely existence of the direction-asymmetric critical current remains unchanged\n",
    "as revealed clearly in the manuscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplified model of two Majorana fermions described in the first version\n",
    "of our manuscript, delta_1 and delta_2 correspond to the real and imaginary\n",
    "parts of the off-diagonal terms respectively. In this case, the unequal\n",
    "interactions raise a phase unequal to pi/4. However, this phase is absorbed by a\n",
    "gauge transformation, and leaves no consequence in the time evolution of\n",
    "Majorana state and the Josephson current.\n",
    "\n",

    "In their manuscript Wang, Liang and Hu (hereafter 'the authors')\n",
    "consider, theoretically, a dc-SQUID which is composed of conventional\n",
    "Josephson junction (JJ) on one side and a Majorana nanowire on the\n",
    "other. If compared to a regular dc-SQUID, the novel feature of this\n",
    "setup is the inclusion of the wire which serves as a 1D Majorana JJ.\n",
    "\n",
    "I personally find that the authors' claim that such setup can be used\n",
    "to detect Majoranas (e.g. \"this phenomenon would provide evidence for\n",
    "Majorana fermions\" from the abstract and \"If found... it is evidence\n",
    "for Majorana fermions...\" from the conclusion) is, to say the least,\n",
    "unjustified. In particular, asymmetry of the critical current - the\n",
    "claimed manifestation of Majoranas - has been known in the\n",
    "superconducting literature since late 1960s. I also believe that some\n",
    "of authors' statements actually contradict their findings. Given the\n",
    "abundance of proposals to detect 1D Majoranas and, at the very best,\n",
    "incremental role of this one, I cannot recommend its publication in\n",
    "PRL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me elaborate.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The field asymmetry of the critical current in JJs and SQUIDs is\n",
    "not at all unique to Majoranas, see, e.g. Yamashita and Onodera, J.\n",
    "Appl. Phys. 38, 3523 (1967) and also the book of Kulik and Yanson,\n",
    "Josephson Effect in Superconducting Tunneling Structures, 1972. This\n",
    "implies that such feature cannot be used as a decisive signature,\n",
    "contrary to the authors' believe. Also, as has been pointed out by\n",
    "Referee B, the asymmetry of CPRs is well known as well and does not\n",
    "require Majorana JJs. So, the optimism of the authors that asymmetries\n",
    "\"can serve as and ideal probe for the MFs\" (yet another quote) is very\n",
    "much unfounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) It seems to me that the authors' statement that \"the interplay\n",
    "between ... 4pi period and the well-known 2pi period ... leads to the\n",
    "asymmetry...\" actually contradicts their findings. In fig 1a, the CPR\n",
    "of the adiabatic process is 2pi periodic. Yet, in fig 2d Ic is\n",
    "obviously asymmetric!\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the saw-tooth CPR computed by the authors for an adiabatic\n",
    "Majorana JJ is well-known for long superconducting wires (and other\n",
    "systems as well). Given that the authors actually consider a wire with\n",
    "the proximity-induced superconductivity, seeing such a CPR cannot, at\n",
    "any rate, be considered as a direct signature of Majoranas.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Finally, let me point out that a much simpler experiment that can\n",
    "do the trick. CPRs of various junctions have been routinely measured\n",
    "for many years using rf-SQIUDs - a ring with only one JJ - see, e.g.\n",
    "Frolov et al. Phys. Rev. B 70, 144505 (2004). This type of experiment\n",
    "can directly demonstrate the 4pi periodicity and, hence, is a much\n",
    "more plausible tool for experimental detection of Majorana JJs.\n",

    "Reply C1: We thank this Referee for raising questions on our work.However, we\n",
    "cannot agree with the comment of this Referee. Although asymmetric critical\n",
    "currents may appear in other systems due to various mechanisms, such as magnetic\n",
    "inductance of strong current in a conventional Josephson junction, or d-wave\n",
    "pairing, they can be distinguished unambiguously from the present case which we\n",
    "are discussing as an evidence of Majorana fermions (MFs). The key point here is\n",
    "that the Josephson junction with spin-orbit-coupling nanowire exhibits an\n",
    "unconventional current-phase relation (CPR) in its topologically non-trivial\n",
    "state with MFs, and that the junction can be easily tuned into a topologically\n",
    "trivial state with conventional CPR (see J. A. V. Dam et al. Nature vol. 442,\n",
    "667, 2006) by simply rotating the magnetic field applied to the nanowire (see\n",
    "the introduction of our last manuscript). This switching between trivial and\n",
    "topological states has been achieved by Kouwenhoven group (Science vol. 336\n",
    "(2012) 1003) experimentally, and served as the key ingredient of their method to\n",
    "probe MFs through the zero-bias peak in conductance. Our setup shares the same\n",
    "merit as this previous experiment, namely the asymmetric critical current\n",
    "appears when the magnetic field is applied in parallel to the nanowire, and will\n",
    "disappear when the magnetic field is vertical to the nanowire. With this\n",

    "There are a bunch of proposals for detecting MFs. Up to the time of this\n",
    "writing, only the zero-bias peak in conductance found by Kowenhovens group\n",

    "this situation lies largely in the fact that many proposals require severe\n",

    "SQUID setup proposed in our manuscript does not require a severer condition than\n",
    "the experiment realized by Kowenhoven et al. We wish to notice that Kowenhoven\n",

    "Majorana Josephson junction with a conventional SIS junction to form a SQUID,\n",
    "which is not a difficult task in experiment. Then a measurement on the critical\n",
    "current, which is already a routine procedure, will provide a phase-sensitive\n",
    "signature for MFs, complementary to the zero-bias peak in conductance, the only\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reply to comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "C1: Here is the punch line: I believe that conclusions of the manuscript are flawed. Enclosed to this response is a counter example which demonstrates this (in the pdf file).\n",
    "\n",
    "R1: We would appreciate much better this explicit comment if this Referee had raised it in the first report.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let us respond it by restating first the stream of our work: I) In high-quality MF states or quick MF dynamics (criteria have been given around Eq.(7) ), the CPR of a MF Josephson junction is sin(theta/2) of 4pi period; for adiabatic MF dynamics, 2pi-period CPR with a sharp drop at pi appears (see Eq. (9) and red dot line in Fig. 2(a)); II) In both cases, a SQUID with the MF Josephson junction in one branch and a conventional junction in the other branch exhibits a directionally asymmetric critical current; III) This phenomenon, if found experimentally, is an important signal for MF states, since an asymmetric critical current in SQUID in weak current regime has not been found experimentally so far for other reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Referee raised a sawtooth-shaped CPR with 2pi period, and discussed that it can also induce an asymmetric critical current in SQUID. A sawtooth-shaped CPR was known theoretically in ballistic systems, such as SNS junction in clean limit, for long time. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no experimental report on a phenomenon originated from this property. This indicates that the condition of ballistic transport in conventional junction is hardly satisfied in reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrary, the MF state is a topological feature of the superconductor/ spin-orbit coupling semiconductor heterostructure under appropriate magnetic field, and is robust to local perturbations. This provides a good chance to detect the asymmetric critical current in the SQUID proposed in our work. In this sense, our proposal is physically novel and concrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, although there may be other possible mechanisms to cause asymmetric critical current of SQUID on a pure theoretical level, with a general anti-symmetry breaking documented in our manuscript, they are not plausible in real systems, and cannot serve as counter example to our proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we suggest that one can rotate the Zeeman field for realizing the MF states, a technique adopted by Kouwenhoven et al., and transform the topological state with MFs to a trivial state without MF. This double check on the appearance and disappearance of asymmetric critical current enhances greatly the uniqueness of MF states as its origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "C2: Intentionally or not, in their manuscript and response, the authors use sleight of hand. Typical example of this is their answer to my comment 3 from the previous round of reviews which was: How come both 2pi and 4pi periodic CPRs show asymmetry in Ic if such asymmetry is (\"an unambiguous\") signature for MFs? The authors start their answer with a definitive \"There is no contradiction here\" and just a few lines below admit that \"... a complex wave-shape of 2pi appears which also leads to the asymmetry of critical current\" (\"complex\" here means complicated).\n",
    "\n",
    "R2: As mentioned in R1, the sin(theta/2) CPR with 4pi period and 2pi-periodic CPR with the sharp drop at pi (in Eq.(9) and red dot line in Fig. 2a) are derived for the two limits of MF dynamics. Both of them induce asymmetric critical current, and thus both serve as evidence for MFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the review process, Referee A suggested us to make a more concise introduction, in order to improve the accessibility of our work to broad audience. We then included only the 4pi CPR in high-quality MF system in the introductory part in later versions of our manuscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to avoid possible misunderstanding, as pointed out by this Referee in the last and present report, we re-phrase the introductory part into “unconventional current-phase relation (CPR) in MF states, such as $\\sin (\\theta/2)$ in a high-quality MF junction, and the conventional one $\\sin \\theta$”. We hope that this introduction, plus detailed discussions presented in the main body of text, will not leave misunderstanding to a careful reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to put it clear that our main statement has never been changed since our first submission, and there is no “sleight of hand” in our reply and manuscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "C3: I take this as the coup de grace: This statement invalidates the main claim of the manuscript since any practical (experimental) weak link, unlike theoretical models, has a complex CPR which could be quite different from a regular sine wave. Yes, MFs may produce the field asymmetry in the critical current but so do billion other things! The authors rescue boat - the tunability of MFs with the Zeeman coupling - is of no help here.\n",
    "\n",
    "R3: We have to point out that the asymmetric critical current in SQUID is not a common phenomenon in an experimental point of view, in contrary to the belief of this Referee. As a matter of fact, the known case for asymmetric critical current is caused by the magnetic field self-induced by strong current, which is however not the regime under concern in the context of MF states.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true that, in addition to the leading term of sine function of phase, Josephson current may have corrections of higher harmonics due to many reasons. However, for weak current under concern in the present context, correction terms are suppressed quickly, leaving a pure sin(theta) CPR. It is the reason why traditional SQUIDs exhibit symmetric critical current in experiments. In a sharp contrast, a MF Josephson junction exhibits either a sin(theta/2) CPR of 4pi period or 2pi-periodic CPR with complicated shape even for small critical current.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we wish to say that tunability of MFs with Zeeman coupling is not a “rescue boat”, it is a very important step to check MF state, as realized by Kouwenhoven et al. As a matter of fact, many recent experiments use this technique, making it common in this field. This process can rule out other possible unknown mechanisms, and strongly enhance the significance of the asymmetric critical current as an evidence for MFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "C4: The authors also want their work to look \"novel\", as if it appears in vacuum, without mentioning previous conceptually very similar proposals to detect MF. In fact, one of the such proposals has been realized (more than half a year ago!) and which the authors ignore is reported here: 1204.4212.\n",
    "\n",
    "R4: We would appreciate much better this comment if this Referee had raised it in the first report. As for the work of 1204.4212, we wish to remind this Referee that the present work was actually submitted to PRL half year ago, almost the same time when the work 1204.4212 was uploaded to arXiv. It is therefore not surprising that it did not appear in our reference list. We add this work as a note added to proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of changes:\n",
    "1) We summarize the main point in reply to this Referee into a section of ‘Discussion’ at the end of manuscript, and remove the ‘Conclusion’ section. Meanwhile, we delete the last part of the section of ‘Asymmetric critical current’, which discussed the same point as in Discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)In the third paragraph of Introduction we rephrase the brief description of our work as ‘We predict a directionally asymmetric critical current in this SQUID due to the interplay between the unconventional current-phase relation (CPR) in MF states, unconventional current-phase relation (CPR) in MF states, such as $\\sin (\\theta/2)$ in a high-quality MF junction, and the conventional one $\\sin \\theta$’.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)In the section of ‘Rectification effect’ section, we delete the last part in order to save space.\n",

    "  We have read carefully the second report from Referee C.  Unfortunately we find this report is unfair in the point of view of reviewing process, and meanwhile not valuable physically. Referee C introduced a detailed model as a counter example to our work in the second report, which s/he could have done in the first report. S/he criticized that we did not refer to previous works ‘intentionally’, a comment s/he could have raised in the first report too. This made the reviewing process unnecessarily delayed, and reduced much, if not deprived completely, our opportunity to rebut and to improve the manuscript appropriately.\n",

    "  This Referee introduced a sawtooth-shaped CPR with 2pi period, and discussed that it can also induce an asymmetric critical current in SQUID.

    "  Therefore, we have to say that the opinion of this Referee is biased, and some of the comments are even emotional, and can hardly be taken as a base for academic judgment on our work.\n",

    "\n",

    ">Comment 1: In the present manuscript, the authors consider Majorana fermions (MFs) occurring in an s-wave superconductor-semiconductor with S-O coupling -ferromagnetic insulator (S/SM/FI) heterostructure (brick) by assuming the presence of a single vortex in each brick and argue that their computation implies the nonAbelian statistics of the MFs. They stress that they have studied the edge MF rather than that at the vortex core which have been studied by others so far.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The preceding studies addressing the non-Abelian statistics of MFs as the statistics obeyed by the vortices have been of interest through comparison with the previous study of that of vortices in a bose liquid as an issue in quantum condensed matter physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reply 1: The most important result of our analyses, both numerical and analytical, is to indicate unambiguously that edge MFs can be transported in an easy way, namely just applying gate voltage at point-like constriction junction between samples, based on the intrinsic topological property of MFs. Non-Abelian statistics is not our main, innovative contribution, and conceptually it is not different from previous works on core MFs in vortex state and end MFs in nanowires.  We check the braiding of edge MFs carefully in our manuscript, because it is crucially important for any implementation of TQC, and not trivial in the present case.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Comment 2: This study is interesting for experts in that the non-Abelian statistics has been verified through an explicit computation. However, it has already been obvious as a theoretical result that the MFs obey the non-Abelian statistics. So, I do not feel that the present study is innovative. Actually, the present study is never based on a new idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reply 1: We cannot agree with the comment from this Referee. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was shown by Read and Green (PRB 2000) that a vortex in spinless chiral p-wave superconductor accommodates a MF as the zero-energy excitation. Ivanov (PRL 2001) then showed that braiding vortices rotates the wave functions in the ground state degenerate subspace following the non-Abelian statistics, and thus the vortex state can be used to implement topological quantum computation (TQC). However, there are two problems in practice with this wonderful idea, namely (1) spinless chiral p-wave superconductivity has not been confirmed clearly in any compounds, and (2) transporting vortices is by no means an easy task. Very recently, it has been revealed by Lutchyn et al. (PRL 2010) that a S/SM/FI hetero structure, with S for s-wave superconductor, SM for spin-orbit coupling semiconductor (SM), and FI for ferromagnetic insulator (FI), works similarly to the spinless chiral p-wave superconductor, which solves the first problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the present work, we propose a way to solve the second problem by using the edge MFs, which are the counterpart of MFs at vortex cores and appear at the sample edge as guaranteed by the particle-hole symmetry. Our device is composed by samples of S/SM/FI hetero structure, each trapping one vortex at the center and connected to others with point-like constriction junctions, which we called a brick. Taking the advantage of their distributions at brick edges, we demonstrate that edge MFs can be transported and exchanged simply by turning on and off gate voltages at the point-like constriction junctions in a designed sequence. It should be emphasized that the transportation of edge MFs in our system has its root in the topological property, namely edge MF states appear when the sample perimeter (i.e. edge) includes odd vorticity, and should disappear for even vorticity. With our design, one can circumvent the bottleneck of vortex manipulation in Ivanov’s original idea. Our present proposal therefore bridges successfully the fundamental topological features of MFs and practical devices for TQC. \n",
    "Our system has advantages as compared with the existing proposals for manipulating MFs in literatures. In the proposal by Fu et al. (PRL 2008) based on superconductor and topological insulator, manipulation of MFs is based on tuning the phase of superconductivity, which is not a trivial task; additionally the non-Abelian property was not proved for their setup. In the proposal by Alicea et al. (Nat. Phys. 2010) based on network of nanowires of spin-orbit coupling 1D semiconductor under magnetic field in proximity to an s-wave superconductor, the non-Abelian feature has been addressed. However, the end MFs in their setup should be moved by application of gate voltage over the whole 1D nanowires, a process which should be very delicate in order to avoid destroying the whole topological state. In contrast, in our present setup, one has only to tune gate voltages at point-like constriction junctions, which drives easily the edge MFs to desired positions while keeping the topological property of the whole system. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, our proposal reveals for the first time that the topological feature of edge MFs can be used for stable and easily-implemented MF braidings, which is the most important step of TQC, and thus should be considered as innovative. \n",
    "\n",
    "The non-Abelian statistics for MFs is not proven for the first time, as pointed out by this Referee, and actually mentioned explicitly in the introduction of manuscript. However, since non-Abelian statistics is crucially important for TQC, it should be reconfirmed in any system proposed as its implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we wish to bring the attention of this Referee to the point that the proof of non-Abelian statistics of core MFs by Ivanov cannot be applied directly to the edge MFs in the present setup, since it is not trivial to indentify the motion of edge MFs around a vortex during the braiding. We also wish to notice that Alicea et al recently published an important paper (Nat. Phys. 2010) to prove in a detailed way the non-Abelian feature of end MFs in nanowires, although it has already been known since the work by Kitaev (Ann. Phys. 2003).\n",
    "\n",
    ">Comment 2: In conclusion, this study appears to be suitable for a scientific journal that treats the topological order. However, it is not appropriate for PRL which focuses on innovative works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reply 2: As discussed in the above reply, our work contains new results, which, on one hand, have their root in the topological property of the system, and, on the other hand, exhibit potential as an implementation of TQC. Therefore, we believe the present work will receive much attention from the broad scope of readers of PRL. Reconsideration of this Referee is highly appreciated.\n",
